# Interactive Graph
Welcome to my project!
I worked on this assignment for my course Data Visualisation and Networking as a part of my Master's Credits. This file contains the dataset used for analysis and the jupyter file used for coding in Python. 
This contains an interactive bubble graph displaying total covid deaths and cases of countries.
